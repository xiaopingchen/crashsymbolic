#crash symbolic tool#

Because xcode6 removed the symbolic from organizer, and alway can't remember the command, so write the app.

The app will find **symbolicatecrash** from xcode sub folder, and use the script to symbolicate the crash.

I test it on xcode6 and OS X Yosemite.

The app refer most from [symbolicatecrash-mac](https://github.com/nikyoudale/symbolicatecrash-mac)
